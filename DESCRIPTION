Description: This package tries to build an implementation of a "reactive"
    Input-Output matrix. Demand in a sector is subdivided into commodities and
    then inserted as inputs to a (marginal) production function for a sector.
    This produces a new output value which is then recalibrated to total
    output using the RAS methodology, and then fed back to produce new
    inter-industry multipliers under the new demand.
